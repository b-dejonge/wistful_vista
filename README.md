&nbsp;&nbsp;-Keep tract of the rent payments<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Keep track of maintenance requests<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Allow renters to log in and pay their rents<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Allow renters to request maintenance<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Allow the manager to log in and see the all of the rent payments and all of the mainmaintenance requests<br>

I am new to developing websites in PHP therfore some of my coding techniques may not by standard. Also we must follow how we do things in the book which also may vary from current standards.
